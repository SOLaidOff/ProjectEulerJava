# ProjectEulerJava

Just like it says, these are the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, solved in Java.

This is a second skills development/showcase project.

__NB:__ For the first few days/problems, __the code here will be intentionally quick-and-dirty__. Based on dusty memories of attempting Project Euler years and years ago, some of the later problems end up building on the earlier ones or using some of the same math principles. I don't remember exactly which ones they are, but I'm pretty sure they're coming. After 50 problems or so, when I have a better idea of what the requirements are (so to speak), I'll go back write some library/helper functions and refactor the earlier stuff. That's the plan, anyways.
